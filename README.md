### ðŸ“‘ Ignite TODO List

---
As part of a challenge from Ignite (*an acceleration program for devs, focused on preparing complete professionals for the market, training technical and behavioral skills in an intensive and practical way*) developed by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/), this project has been built in order to practice some concepts from **React** such as **State**, **Imutability** and **Hooks**.
Also, it was the first time I worked with **Jest** so as to be able testing the Tasks handlers methods;


The UI was built by Rocketseat Team and I'm willing to improve it by adding some breakpoints to make it able to work on mobile screens.
